// No UI should occur during this stage (i.e, do not prompt for authorization prompts, show package installer apps, etc..)
// Should be able to be called from non-main thread

// Stage 2 is where any further installation work can be done prior to the user application being terminated
// If the authorizationEnvironment flag is nil, then this and the 3rd stage cannot request authorization if the updater has insufficient privileges to install
// Otherwise if it's non-nil, then they can request authorization and they will use the environment that's passed.
// The allowsUI flag indicates whether this and the 3rd stage can show UI or not, possibly affecting whether or not this stage succeeds.
// Eg: This may be appropriate for first showing an authorization prompt before the user application is terminated (if the operation succeeds)
// Should be able to be called from non-main thread

// Stage 3 occurs after the user application has has been terminated. This is where the final installation work can be done.
// After this stage is done, the user application will be relaunched.
// Should be able to be called from non-main thread
