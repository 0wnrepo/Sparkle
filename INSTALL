== Building ==

If release products have not already been built, they can be built by:

> make release

Or build the "Distribution" scheme from within the Xcode project.

Debug builds of Sparkle can also be built from Xcode. Note that debug builds change Sparkle's default behavior to ease development. Never use a debug build of Sparkle for distribution.

== Installing ==

To install Sparkle, you can copy Sparkle.framework into your project as you would any other framework. Make sure you have a build phase to copy the framework into your application's Frameworks directory.

Sparkle has a few components that can optionally be handed off to XPC services. If you sandbox your application, you will need to use all or some of these.

If you code sign your application, these XPC services will also need to be signed by you with the attached entitlements. Included is a script to automate this.

Here is an example of invoking the script with my Developer ID:
> ./bin/codesign_xpc_services "Developer ID Application" XPCServices/

After signing the services, copy them into your project and set up a build phase to embed the XPC Services into your application.

Then test if your application works :).
