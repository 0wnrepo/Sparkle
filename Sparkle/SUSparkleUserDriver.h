 Send a signal to the user driver that the user application should terminate.
 
 This should only be invoked if the user driver's delegate says it's responsible for signaling application termination,
 and this should only be called from NSApplicationDelegate's applicationShouldTerminate: method.
 
 This is particularly useful when the user driver and updater live in separate processes, and the updater
 wants to install an automatic update on termination. If the updater is in a separate process, that means
 we may have to defer application termination a bit until the updater is ready to launch its auto updater.
 
 @return The NSApplication termination reply. Use this as a return value to NSApplicationDelegate's applicationShouldTerminate:
