/*!
 Invalidate the current update installation
 
 This stops all behavior for the current update installation. It avoids making any calls or replies to Sparkle's updater.
 Note this does not change the idle state of update checks (i.e, -idlesOnUpdateChecks), but it will invalidate any pending update checks.
 One may want to check if there is a pending update check (i.e, -willInitiateNextUpdateCheck) before making this call to decide if the
 user driver should be invalidated or not
 
 This is appropriate to call when the connection to the updater has been interrupted or invalidated. Note this class is still re-usable
 in the case that the connection should be later resumed.
