@class SUUpdater;
@class SUSparkleUserDriver;

/*!
 A controller class that instantiates a SUUpdater and allows binding UI to it.
 
 This controller's updater targets the application's main bundle, and uses Sparkle's standard user interface.
 Thus it is only suitable under these circumstances. Typically, this class is used by sticking it as a custom NSObject in an Interface Builder nib (probably in MainMenu).
 The controller then kicks off creating an SUUpdater instance and allows hooking up the check for updates action and menu item validation.
 
 There may be several reasons why this class may not be suitable for you:
 * You want to control or defer the instantiation of an SUUpdater, or don't want to be tied into a nib's instantiation, or don't want to use a nib
 * You want to separate Sparkle's updater and user interface into separate processes
 * You want to provide a custom user interface, or perhaps one that provides little-to-none
 * You don't want to use a convenience class that provides very little glue ;)
