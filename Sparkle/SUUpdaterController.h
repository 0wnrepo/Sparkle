@class SUUpdater;

/*!
 A controller class that instantiates a SUUpdater and allows binding UI actions and outlets to it.
 
 This controller's updater targets the application's main bundle, and uses Sparkle's standard user interface.
 Thus it is only suitable under these circumstances. Typically, this class is used by sticking it as a custom NSObject in an Interface Builder nib (probably in MainMenu).
 The controller then kicks off creating an SUUpdater instance and allows hooking up various actions and outlets.
 
 There may be several reasons why this class may not be very suitable for you:
 * You want to defer the instantiation of an SUUpdater, or don't want to be tied into a nib's instantiation, or don't want to use a nib
 * You want to separate Sparkle's updater and user interface into separate processes
 * You don't want to use a convenience class that provides very little glue ;)
