@class SPUUpdatePermission, SUAppcastItem;

/*!
 The API in Sparkle for controlling the user interaction.
 
 This protocol is used for implementing a user interface for the Sparkle updater. Sparkle's internal drivers tell
 an object that implements this protocol what actions to take and show to the user.
 
 Every method in this protocol has a void return type and can optionally take a single parameter block, which waits for
 a response back from the user driver. Note that every parameter block, or reply, *must* be responded to eventually -
 that is, none can be ignored. Furthermore, they can only be replied to *once* - a reply or completion block should be considered
 invalidated after it's once used. The faster a reply can be made, the more Sparkle may be able to idle, and so the better.
 Lastly, every method in this protocol can be called from any thread. Thus, an implementor may choose to always
 dispatch asynchronously to the main thread. However, an implementor should also avoid unnecessary nested asynchronous dispatches.
 
 An implementor of this protocol should act defensively. For example, it may be possible for an action that says to
 invalidate or dismiss something to be called multiple times in succession, and the implementor may choose to ignore further requests.
